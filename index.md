## About Me

I am a PhD Scholar at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIITD). I am working under the guidance of Dr. Mukulika Maity from IIT Madras and Dr. Sandip Chakraborty from IIT Kharagpur. Before joining my PhD at IIITD, I did my M. Tech from USICT, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India in 2020.

## Research Interests


My research focuses broadly on networks and systems, with a particular emphasis on Internet measurement of the next-generation QUIC protocol and the design and development of optimized video streaming for both limited and high-speed networks. Throughout my PhD, I have worked extensively with the open-source Chromium browser, contributing modifications and collecting datasets that are made publicly available as open-source resources.
