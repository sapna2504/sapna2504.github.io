## About Me

I am a PhD Scholar at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIITD). I am working under the guidance of Dr. Mukulika Maity and Dr. Sandip Chakraborty from IIT Kharagpur. Before joining my PhD at IIITD, I did my M. Tech from USICT, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India in 2020.

## Research Interests

My research interest lies broadly in the area of networks and systems. I work in the area of Internet measurement of next-generation protocol QUIC and design and development of optimized video streaming over a limited and high-speed network. Throughout my PhD work, I work on the open-source chromium-browser. The chromium modifications and the dataset collected are open-source.
